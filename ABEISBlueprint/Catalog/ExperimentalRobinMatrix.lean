This chapter is generated from the Lean source. Every node denotes one explicit public
declaration, and every Lean link is checked during the Blueprint build. Definitions appear
in source order before later results whenever the source module does so.

Reader orientation: Historical Robin-matrix research outside the default import surface; its open diagnostics are displayed as obligations. Each card separates an accessible
reading cue from formal status, the source docstring, and the authoritative Lean panel.
The standalone Library Explorer adds full-text search and filters across every chapter.

*Experimental status.* RobinMatrix.lean is not imported by the default library
surface. It is catalogued for completeness and contains explicit sorry-guarded
diagnostic theorems. Those nodes are visible obligations, not certified facts.

# QuantumBlockEncoding/RobinMatrix.lean

396 explicit public declarations, in source order.

:::definition "QuantumBlockEncoding.stencilRowCoeff" (lean := "QuantumBlockEncoding.stencilRowCoeff")
*Plain-English reading.* This definition gives the library's named construction or computation for “stencil row coeff”. Coefficient at column 'colIdx' when the stencil 'entries' is applied at row 'rowIdx'.

*Formal status.* Outside the default import surface. Read the chapter warning and the Lean panel status before using this declaration as evidence.

*Why it is in this chapter.* Historical Robin-matrix research outside the default import surface; its open diagnostics are displayed as obligations.

*Technical source note.* Coefficient at column 'colIdx' when the stencil 'entries' is applied at row 'rowIdx'. Only entries whose offset lands on 'colIdx' contribute; the result is the sum of all matching coefficients. Returns bare 'Coeff' (no zero-wrapping) when exactly one entry matches.

*Plain-English reading.* This record groups the data and proof fields needed for “one term robin gamma 3 boundary unique path support audit”. A proposition-valued field is a requirement until a constructor supplies it. Boundary unique-path support audit for the displayed 'n = 3' gamma3 branch.

*Formal status.* Outside the default import surface. Read the chapter warning and the Lean panel status before using this declaration as evidence.

*Why it is in this chapter.* Historical Robin-matrix research outside the default import surface; its open diagnostics are displayed as obligations.

*Technical source note.* Boundary unique-path support audit for the displayed 'n = 3' gamma3 branch. This record is intentionally narrower than the final product theorem. It proves the concrete adjacent-branch zero entries currently available from the gate skeletons, then names the first missing global support interface needed before 'Matrix.evalWith\_mul\_unique\_path' can isolate the full seven-gate product.

*Technical source note.* Compiled audit for the first boundary unique-path support packet. The target path is the ket-zero branch '32 -> 32 -> 32 -> 32 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 32'. The adjacent boundary-rotation ket-one branch reaches the row-'33' endpoint, and its contribution to target row '32' is killed by concrete zero entries in the current 'O\_f' and dagger matrices. The remaining all-other-path support theorem is still an explicit false obligation.

Support only at row '0'. Compiled. 3. 'DU = O\_DT^S \* U\_indic' at column '0': support only at row '0'. Compiled. 4. 'Ry\_boundary' at column '0': acts on the '(0, 1)' rotation pair. 'Ry\[0, 0\] = cosHalf' and 'Ry\[1, 0\] = sinHalf' are both non-zero. Support at rows '\{0, 1\}'. Compiled. 5.

The next proof obligation is: - Add the suffix-side support for row '0' (dagger concentrates at column '96', SWAP maps to row '12', 'O\_f' spreads from there) - Build the two-path reduction for '\[0,0\]' through intermediate rows '\{96, 97\}' - Compare the resulting entry with the backend fold under HWKappa This record does not promote any 'proved' flag.

*Technical source note.* Uniform-column and adjoint-entry contract split for the focused dagger entry. The embedded interface fixes the local row and column. This record splits the remaining semantic source into the cited clean-column amplitude 'H\_W^(kappa)\[2,0\] = 1/sqrt(kappa)' and the QBE adjoint-entry convention that turns that column entry into the bra-side dagger entry. Both source inputs remain obligations; the only compiled theorem is the conditional entry lemma above.

*Technical source note.* Finite signal-block index lemma for the focused product/projection bridge. The conditional product route works with the branch basis index '32', where sparse slot '2' and system column '0' are embedded in the full circuit basis. The finite block-composition contract, however, exposes the signal-zero block entry at compound row and column '0' for the '(0,0)' system entry. This lemma records that finite indexing fact without claiming that the branch product has already been summed into the block entry.

*Technical source note.* QBE-AUTO-002: sorry-guarded obstruction record for the H-free raw Coeff fold (n=3). This is the DIAGNOSTIC H-free route, not the source-correct prepared projection route. The source-correct route is 'oneTermRobinGamma3BoundaryEvaluatedBackendFoldStatement\_of\_activePreparedEval\_n3', which routes through the prepared singleton clean entry under the 'H\_W^(kappa)' clean-column contract. The raw Coeff equality 'signalUnitaryEntry = blockExtractionBranchContributionSum' is the missing finite projection theorem. Approaches tried: - 'rfl': hits maxRecDepth (even at 4096) - 'native\_decide': OOM/timeout (19GB RSS, killed after 780s) - Both sides unfold to deeply nested Coeff expressions involving 7 gate matrices. After rewriting via 'oneTermRobinGamma3BoundarySignalUnitaryEntry\_evalGateMatrices\_n3', the LHS reduces to '(evalGateMatrices gates) \[0,0\]'. The RHS is the seven-slot backend fold 'Sum\_\{s:Fin 7\} sevenGateMatrix\[idx(s),idx(s)\] \* projFactor'. These are structurally different Coeff expressions whose equality encodes the finite projection/summation theorem for the 1-term Robin boundary branch.
