This chapter is generated from the Lean source. Every node denotes one explicit public
declaration, and every Lean link is checked during the Blueprint build. Definitions appear
in source order before later results whenever the source module does so.

Reader orientation: State-preparation and exact rational Householder developments for the cubic benchmark family. Each card separates an accessible
reading cue from formal status, the source docstring, and the authoritative Lean panel.
The standalone Library Explorer adds full-text search and filters across every chapter.

The final call is a placeholder cleanup for the zero-input filter. The row-generation step is intentionally not uncomputed, because the output row is the system output of the rank-one operator.

*Technical source note.* Oracle-level transcript for the Hadamard-counting route. The row XOR is not uncomputed, because it writes the output system row for the rank-one operator. The separate nonzero-column reject signal is applied before the 'nz' cleanup, so nonzero input columns keep a clean-projection rejection witness. The Hadamard layers and reversible arithmetic are still semantic obligations at this interface tier.
