# Exact-comparison binary search for the Hermite source cutoff

The implementation carries real interval endpoints instead of evaluating a
natural ceiling or enumerating the grid. Its counters cover real arithmetic
and exact real comparisons. Natural index arithmetic, powers of two, and
counter bookkeeping are outside this scalar model; finite-bit comparison of
arbitrary real inputs is not claimed. In particular this does not remove the
input/separation issue recorded in the classical-cost audit.
